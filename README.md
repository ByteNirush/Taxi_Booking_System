# 🚖 Taxi Online Booking System

## 📌 Project Overview
**"Taxi Online Booking System"** is a desktop-based application developed as part of my final project at the University of Bedfordshire. The project aims to enhance skills in **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **Database integration** through the design and development of a fully functional taxi booking platform.

This system was developed independently, covering the full **Software Development Life Cycle** (SDLC) — from analysis, design, and implementation to testing and validation.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-User Roles**: Supports three distinct user types – **Customer**, **Driver**, and **Administrator**.
- **Customer Functionalities**: Registration, trip booking, trip history viewing, and trip cancellation.
- **Driver Functionalities**: Access to assigned trips, update trip logs, and view past trip records.
- **Administrator Panel**: Complete system overview, booking assignment to drivers, and management of both customer and driver data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and clean GUI built using Tkinter.
- **Reliable Database Management**: Back-end powered by SQLite for efficient data handling and referential integrity.
- **Efficient System Design**: Structured with UML, activity, and class diagrams for optimized workflow and maintainability.
- **Performance-Oriented**: Built with computing principles for scalability and responsiveness.
- **Scope for Future Enhancements**: Real-time tracking, mobile integration, and analytics dashboards can be added in future versions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core language used for building the system’s logic.
- **Tkinter** – GUI toolkit used to create a desktop-friendly user interface.
- **SQLite** – Lightweight database solution for storing user and booking data.
- **SQLite3 Module** – Python's standard library to communicate with the SQLite database.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – Used to structure the system in a modular and scalable way.
- **Pillow (Optional)** – Utilized for managing and displaying images/icons within the GUI.
