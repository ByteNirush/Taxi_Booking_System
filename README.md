<h1>Project Overview</h1> <br>
<p>"The Taxi Online Booking System" is a desktop application that we have developed as part of our 
final project work at the University of Bedfordshire. It has been intended for improvement of our 
programming skills in Python, Tkinter, and Database integration. I was assigned to develop from 
start to end analysis, design, implementation, and testing a complete and fully operating system by 
myself. </p>
